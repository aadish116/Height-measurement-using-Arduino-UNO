# Height-measurement-using-Arduino-UNO

The system of this tool has an input in the form
 of an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. The input
 received is in the form of sensor measurement
 data, which will be processed by the Arduino
 Uno microcontroller. At the output, there is a
 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to display the
